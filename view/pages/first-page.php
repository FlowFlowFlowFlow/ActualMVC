            This website was created in PHP without frameworks. Its code has a close resemblance to the code used in <a href="https://github.com/laracasts/PHP-For-Beginners-Series">Jeffrey Way's "PHP-For-Beginners-Series".</a> However, all code was (re)written by hand, by me, and in almost all cases, only when its meaning was grasped. Some code was changed in order to fit the styling and ((for now) absent) purpose.

            The website currently doesn't do anything. You can sign up, log in, log out, navigate between the pages and scroll on the 1000 words Lorem Ipsum page.

            I have wanted to give it a purpose, but have instead moved on to learning Laravel, at which I am still a complete beginner and have created absolutely nothing noteworthy of to share.

            The CSS is currently a mess and zooming was basically disabled so I could focus on learning to write maintainable PHP.

            I think I understand this code fairly well, but still struggle with the concept of containers. I have yet to look up "why" they work, because I moved on to the aforementioned Laravel framework.
